# McCord.chat

A scientific knowledge domain conversational assistant for the general public and the research community for the CORD-19 publication dataset and the research on COVID-19.

## Components, resources & subprojects

_Each heading possibly in a separate repo._

1. CORD-19: full text + metadata as JSON objects, no figures, publications id-ed and networked by allen-nlp.  
   1. Collect PDFs to create datasets for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised training of (the distributed and dynamically integrated components) of a _"paper digester"_.  The goal is to create a _multi-modal transformer_ for the digestion of any scientific paper and document into operational hierarchical inhomogeneous-network format.  PDFs will be converted to images so that the model can learn to use computer vision as the sole input.  
   2. Explore [graph neural networks](https://www.google.com/search?q=graph+neural+network) for the true-Rumelhart PDP representation of knowledge bases with distributed multi-modal representation and identificiation of "concepts" as the compositional and hierarchical units of human (scientivic) knoweledge.  
   3. Figure understanding and generation.  
2. Conversational baseline on Rasa.  
   1. Use [Swivel](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02215) (embeddings [list](https://github.com/Separius/awesome-sentence-embedding)) embeddings and pretrained [Scibert](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10676) ([Github](https://github.com/allenai/scibert)) in DIET model.  
   2. Bot behavior is mostly in the (TED) policy.  
   3. Intents to understand particular topic in the domain must be autogenerated.  
   4. Entities may not be able to be used for PDP concepts. _This will probably be the first extension to Rasa._  
   5. NLG for conversational agent. Likely a long-term project directed toward _Level 4_ (aka [_consultative_](https://blog.rasa.com/5-levels-of-conversational-ai-2020-update/)) agents, which are necessarily heavily interdependent with _representation of normative knowledge_.  
   6. Embedding bot app with synchronized canvas (for figures, interactive sketching, etc). This requires borrowing from _game engines_ and probably a few innovations, especially in deep representation (e.g. embeddings) of knowledge.  
3. Classification of inquiries, mapped to knowledge graph patterns.
   1. Structure of human knowledge and [inductive bias](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01261.pdf) in learning.   
4. Deep provenance of PDP concepts.   
   1. Longitudinal construction dynamics of human consensus knowledge.
